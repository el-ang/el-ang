Welcome visitor!

This is my portofolio in the internet. I like games, memes, movie, anime, pets, and coding. I'm very good at swimming (and surfing the web), also a little on any sport. I love my mom and her cook. I am noob, slow, and many skill issue. My life is not very good, a bit in the edge of the cliff. I'm not very good at socializing and being discipline, but i'm trying to be better.

Still looking for a job, because i'm broke. But i'm only comfortable with part-time job, because my schedule is a mess and i think i still have less experience that i need to learn more. And i only have months of part-time experience at a small giftshop store.

My dream was to become a President, but i think i'm just gonna lower it to any kind of president. It's just because i live in a conflictful place, so i want to make a good change and fix all the mess that've been made. I also want to have a Cafe, my own studio and merch shop. That's all still a dream, but i'm working on it.
