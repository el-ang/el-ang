# Markup & Markdown
- `defer` attribute delay any kind of script inside any kind of tag until the page is loaded.
- You can make your own tag or attribute.
- Script can be modularized.

# Styling
- New size unit: `vw` and `vh` (viewport width and height).
- `calc()` function for any calculation.
- New trigonometry functions.
- Instead of `@import` use `<link>` tag.
- There is `@media` and `@container` for responsive design.
- `@keyframes` for animation and custom timeline.

# Scripting
- `let` and `const` instead of `var`.

- module system is different than basic script.
- `async` and `defer` for script loading.
- `fetch()` for AJAX.
- New method to get array value from the end using `at()` method with negative index.

# Coding
- You can use basic object (`{}`) if the properties and values are not really needed and didn't have to be dynamic.
- Try use `class`, `function`, or `interface` if the objects are necessary and properties are used in many cases.
- New for copying `JavaScript` object can be done with `structuredClone()` method now.
- Avoid causing module stacking loop. :joy:
